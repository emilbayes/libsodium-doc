# The Sodium crypto library \(libsodium\)

Sodium is a modern, easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing and more.

It is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of [NaCl](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/), with a compatible API, and an extended API to improve usability even further.

Its goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.

Sodium supports a variety of compilers and operating systems, including Windows \(with MinGW or Visual Studio, x86 and x86\_64\), iOS and Android.

The design choices emphasize security, and "magic constants" have clear rationales.

And despite the emphasis on high security, primitives are faster across-the-board than most implementations of the NIST standards.

[Version 1.0.12](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/releases) was released on Mar 12, 2017.
